# Unity Codemagic Project for Speed Comparisons

Adapted from: https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/codemagic-sample-projects/tree/main/unity/unity-demo-project.

The **codemagic.yaml** in this project was re-worked to build the Unity project for Mac with Codemagic CI/CD.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Unity **Plus** or **Pro** license. Your license is used to activate Unity on the Codemagic build server so the iOS and Android projects can be exported. The license is then returned before the workflow builds and publishes your apps to the App Store and Google Play.
